# Firebase Functions Configuration
# The Garage 61 API token is now configured server-side in Firebase Functions
# No client-side configuration is needed for authentication

# --- Local development (optional) ---
# To test against the Firebase Functions emulator instead of production, create .env.local with:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_GARAGE61_API_BASE=http://localhost:5001/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/us-central1/garage61Proxy/api/garage61
# Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your Firebase project ID (see .firebaserc). Restart Expo after changing.

# If you need to configure anything else, contact the development team
# All API calls now go through Firebase proxy functions
