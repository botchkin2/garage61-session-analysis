// Why the car was in the pit lane (pit-wall thread 44 #1912, #1921-#1923).
//
// A pit visit is a window of the In Pits channel. Most are a service (fuel,
// VE, tyres), but some are not: a repair after damage, or a penalty served
// (a drive-through, or a stop-go). A visit that is not a service must not teach
// the pit loss or the refuel rate, and must not be read as a strategy. The
// reason is a fact from the data (no coaching): what the car did in the window.
//
// Evidence, all already recorded:
//   speed        the game's ground speed (`speed_kmh`): the time stood still
//   added        fuel and VE added in the window (fuelFacts.mjs)
//   tyres        a wear jump in the window (fuelFacts.mjs tyreChange)
//   damage       the live capture's `mDentSeverity_0..7` and `mDetached`
//                (playerDamage.mjs): lower at the exit than at the entry means
//                the stop repaired something. Absent where the capture is not on
//                the PC (it is pruned after a week): the visit then says so.
//
// Tonight's Road Atlanta race (2026-10-02) read by hand: visit 1, 95.6 s in the
// lane, 61 s stationary, nothing added, dent sum 2 -> 0 and one detached part
// -> 0: a repair. Visit 2, 45.4 s in the lane, 10.4 s stationary, nothing
// added, no damage change: a penalty, a stop-go.

 * reason. A penalty exists only in a race (parc #1957: in practice a run
 * through the lane without stopping is just that, kind 'through'). A
 * repair outranks a service when both happened (the stationary time is the
 * repair's). `did` lists everything that happened in the visit ('refuel',
 * 'tyres', 'repair'), so a repair that also refuelled is
 * {kind: 'repair', did: ['refuel', 'repair']} (parc #1917). `detail` is
 * 'drive-through' or 'stop-go' for a penalty, else null. The pit-loss and
 * refuel-rate learners take kind 'service' only: its stationary time is the
 * service's alone.
 *
 * Input: {inPitS (null when the session ended in the lane), stationaryS (null
 * without a speed channel), added {fuelL, vePct}, tyresChanged, repaired (null
 * without damage samples), race (the session is a race)}.
