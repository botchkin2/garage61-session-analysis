// stop and ~110 GT3 files since 2026-08): `Fuel Level` (L) and `Virtual
// Energy` (%) are 20 Hz channels in every file. Both only fall on track and
// only rise inside an `In Pits` window, as a ramp of about 3.4 L/s. So a
// lap's use is start minus end plus what was added in the pits, and a stop's
// "added" is the rise across its pit window. The two are separate budgets:
// VE per litre differs by car and track (1.0 to 1.5 %/L), so neither is
// derived from the other.
//
// Values are read at the lap's first and last tick, straight between the two
// nearest 20 Hz samples: at most one 20 Hz step from a recorded value, about
// 0.003 L driving and 0.2 L while refuelling.
