# Lap Analysis - React Native App

A React Native application built with TypeScript and best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18)
- npm or yarn
- React Native development environment set up:
  - For iOS: Xcode (macOS only)
  - For Android: Android Studio with Android SDK

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

This project structure is set up, but you'll need to initialize the native iOS and Android projects. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use React Native CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Initialize React Native project (this will create ios/ and android/ folders)
npx react-native init LapAnalysis --template react-native-template-typescript

# Then copy over the src/ folder, App.tsx, and config files from this project
# Or manually merge the configurations
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
If you already have a React Native project initialized, just install dependencies:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. For iOS (macOS only):
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Running the App

#### iOS
```bash
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios
```

#### Android
```bash
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

#### Web (Browser)
```bash
npm run web
# or
yarn web
```
This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000` and open it in your browser.

#### Start Metro Bundler
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Features

- ✅ TypeScript support
- ✅ Organized folder structure
- ✅ Path aliases for cleaner imports
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configured
- ✅ Safe area handling
- ✅ Modern React Native practices
- ✅ **Web support** - Run in browser with React Native Web

## Development

### Code Style

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### TypeScript

TypeScript is configured with strict mode enabled. Path aliases are set up for easier imports:
- `@/` - src root
- `@components/` - components folder
- `@screens/` - screens folder
- `@navigation/` - navigation folder
- `@utils/` - utils folder
- `@types/` - types folder

## Next Steps

This is a basic Hello World app. You can now:
- Add navigation (React Navigation)
- Create new screens and components
- Add state management (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- Integrate APIs
- Add styling libraries (styled-components, etc.)
