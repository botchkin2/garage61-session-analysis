## 🎯 Quick Fixes

### Redundant API Calls

```bash
# Check: Multiple identical network requests in dev tools
# Fix: Implement global request cache + component memoization
# See: API_REQUESTS.md
```

### Component Re-renders

```bash
# Check: Console logs showing excessive renders
# Fix: React.memo + useMemo for expensive computations
# See: COMPONENT_OPTIMIZATION.md
```

### Web Compatibility Issues

```bash
# Check: Animation warnings, style errors
# Fix: useNativeDriver: false, correct style props
# See: REACT_NATIVE_WEB.md
```

## 📋 Development Checklist

Before deploying new features:

- [ ] API requests are deduplicated
- [ ] Components use React.memo appropriately
- [ ] Animations work on web (useNativeDriver: false)
- [ ] Styles use web-compatible props
- [ ] No console.log statements in production
- [ ] Query keys are stable and memoized
