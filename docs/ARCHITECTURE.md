# App architecture

Agreed in pit-wall thread 24 (`decisions/lap/2026-09-27-app-architecture.md`). This file is the reference; change it with the code.

## Folders

```
app/                              routes only: parse params, render features/<x>/<X>Screen
  index.tsx                       Sessions
  session/[id]/index.tsx          Session
  session/[id]/compare.tsx        Compare   (?laps=ref,a,b&hl=&c=&t=&w=; no laps: every comparable lap
                                  of the stint with the most of them, vs their median: stintSetLapIds)
  session/[id]/corner/[n].tsx     Corner
  settings.tsx                    cache management, uploader status
src/
  analysis/   pure TS, no imports at all (Node runs it for the uploader). consistency, corners,
              lap classification, window math, time-diff rebase, 5 m resample.
  nav/        pure URL builders (routes.ts): every in-app link; the URL owns the selection. No imports.
  design/     tokens (dark, light), ThemeProvider, useTheme, lapPalette(mode), fonts
  ui/         primitives with no data: Text, Button, Chip, Checkbox, Segment, Sheet, Tray, Badge
  charts/     react-native-svg chart layer, pure props: Axis, Trace, Band, Cursor, Bars, DotStrip, CornerGrid
  data/<resource>/   client.ts, keys.ts, queries.ts, adapters.ts   (sessions, laps, traces, map)
  state/      zustand, persisted prefs only (chart sets, map shown, stack/one view)
  features/<screen>/  <Screen>Screen.tsx, components/, model.ts (use<Screen>Model), model.test.ts
```

## Layers

`analysis` ← `design` ← `ui`, `charts` ← `data`, `state` ← `features` ← `app`.

- `src/analysis/**` and `src/nav/**` import nothing. Anything may import them.
- `ui` and `charts` may import `design` and `analysis`, never `data`, `state` or `features`.
- Only `app` imports `features`. A feature never imports another feature.
- A component moves from `features/x/components` to `ui` only when a second feature needs it.
- Enforced by `import/no-restricted-paths` in ESLint, at error level.

## Breakpoints

- <900: phone. 900–1279: two-column layouts (`isDesktop`). ≥1280: three-column desktop workspaces (`isWide`). All from `useLayout()`.

## State

- **The URL is the only source of truth for selection:** build links with `src/nav/routes.ts`, never by hand: session, laps, reference (first in `laps`), highlight, corner, cursor and window.
- **Server data** comes only through React Query hooks in `data/`.
- **Zustand** holds persisted preferences only.

## Screens

Worked example: `src/features/sessions/model.ts` and `model.test.ts`.

Every screen follows the same shape: `use<Screen>Model(params)` combines the queries with `analysis` into one view model, and the screen renders it. Models are pure given their inputs and are unit-tested.

### Corner: windows and the Parts row

Corner shows one corner's window: a section's window (boundary to boundary, `tracks/{trackId}.boundaries`) when the section is one corner, or one part's window when it is compound. The charts frame the window from the section's start to the shown corner's end, and shade the window. A compound section's Parts row starts with **All** (`/session/[id]/corner/[n]?all=1`, `n` = first part): the whole window as one corner, same charts, table, Spread and braking map. Stepping through the parts is unchanged. Charts read the last part's slice file, which already runs from the section's start to its end. Which fact comes from where over the whole window (`src/features/corner/wholeCorner.ts`):

| Fact | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Time, slowest speed, apex speed | the section's own facts (full window) |
| Brake point, peak brake, turn-in | one part for the whole set: the part most laps' first brake application brakes for (`brakeApps[0].part`; else the slowest point's part; ties to the earlier), measured to its apex; judged by that part's `minSpeedAtEdge` |
| Pickup, lowest throttle | the last part, measured from its apex; judged by the section's `minSpeedAtEdge` |
| Full throttle | the last part, from its apex, for every lap (a lap already flat there reads "at min"); judged by the section's `minSpeedAtEdge` |

A fact the source cannot supply is "—" (never a boundary value). The braking map spans first entry to last exit and places each lap's points from the same apexes.

## Data hooks (API v2, `/api/lmu`)

`useSessions(filter)`, `useSession(id)`, `useSessionLaps(id)`, `useSessionBand(id)`, `useSessionMap(id)`, `useLapTraces(lapIds)`. Key factories: `sessionKeys.*`, `lapKeys.*`. Uploaded sessions are immutable: staleTime is ∞, and cache busting uses the session `version`.

## Naming

- Components are PascalCase files with one component each. Other modules are camelCase. Hooks are `useX`.
- Units go in names where the unit is ambiguous: `timeS`, `deltaS`, `distanceM`, `speedKph`, `impactG`, `offTrackS`.
- `lapId` is a string and `lapNumber` is an int. Never use a bare `lap` for either.
- One import alias: `@/` (tsconfig). No babel module-resolver aliases.

## Product rule

The app is an instrument, not a coach: no advice text, and every summary number can be drilled into.
