# Android Build Setup and Commands

## Overview

Two build paths are available:

1. **EAS Cloud Build** (primary, recommended): Build on Expo's servers, download APK.
2. **Local Build** (offline fallback): Build locally with Android Studio and the SDK.

## Prerequisites

- Node 24+
- npm 11+
- JDK 17 (Microsoft OpenJDK)
- Android Studio (with platform and build-tools for your Expo SDK version)

## Environment Setup (Local Build Only)

Set these user environment variables (persist across sessions):

- `JAVA_HOME`: Point to your JDK 17 installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-17.*-hotspot`)
- `ANDROID_HOME`: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`

Add to PATH: `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools`

## Android SDK Installation

Through Android Studio's SDK Manager, install the platform and build-tools that match your Expo SDK version:

- Expo 54 / React Native 0.81: Android SDK Platform **36**, Build-Tools 36.x
- Expo 55+: check the [Expo SDK docs](https://docs.expo.dev) for the target version
- **Android SDK Platform-Tools** (adb, fastboot)

Minimum SDK is API 24.

## Build Commands

### EAS Cloud Build (Recommended)

First time only: authenticate with your Expo account.

```powershell
npx eas-cli login
```

Build the development APK:

```powershell
npm run build:android:development
```

This runs `npx eas build --platform android --profile development`. The build happens on Expo's servers. Check your email or the EAS dashboard for the download link or QR code.

Note: Use `npx eas-cli` for individual commands (e.g., `npx eas-cli whoami`). Due to the MSIX sandbox, global `npm install -g eas-cli` may not work as expected; npx reads the latest version from npm registry on each run.

### Local Build (Offline)

Requires local Android setup (JDK, Android Studio, SDK, environment variables).

Build and install on a connected USB phone (Developer options and USB debugging enabled):

```powershell
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

The APK is built locally and installed directly to your phone via adb.

## ABIs

Builds target arm64-v8a only (`expo-build-properties` in app.json), which is enough for a Pixel phone and cuts native C++ compile time (unmeasured; the last all-ABI EAS build took 13m31s). x86 emulators and 32-bit ARM devices will not run these builds; add the ABIs back to `buildArchs` if you need them.

## Troubleshooting

### Long Paths on Windows

Gradle can fail on long file paths. If the build fails with path-length errors, enable Windows long paths or keep the repo path short.

To enable long paths globally (requires admin):

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

### adb not found

Ensure `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` is on PATH and the platform-tools SDK is installed.

```powershell
adb devices
```

Should list connected Android devices.

### Package Name

The package is `app.botracing.android` (apex #225; it was Expo's placeholder `com.anonymous.botracing61`). The package is the app's identity: the Google OAuth client for sign-in, the signing key and every install are tied to it, so a different package is a different app. The old APK does not update to it: it installs beside it with its own data, and is uninstalled once by hand. The first EAS build under this package creates its own signing key; Google sign-in needs an Android OAuth client for this package and that key's SHA-1 (`eas credentials -p android`). The URL scheme in `app.json` (`botracing61`) is separate and unchanged.

## Phone Setup

1. Connect Android phone via USB
2. Enable Developer options (tap Build Number 7 times in Settings > About Phone)
3. Enable USB Debugging in Developer options
4. Accept the RSA fingerprint prompt on the phone when adb connects
5. Verify connection: `adb devices`

## Verification

After build setup, verify everything works:

```powershell
java -version
adb devices
npx eas-cli whoami
```

All three should succeed without errors.

## Release download (server side)

Released APKs are served like the tray installer (pit-wall thread 1 #3270 to #3272). The release workflow writes, under `gs://botracing-61-lmu/android/`, the APK at `<version>/BotRacing-<version>.apk` and then `latest.json`, last. The manifest is written only by `scripts/android-release.mjs` (`buildLatest`): `{version, versionCode, apk, sha256, cert_sha256, published_at}`, where `versionCode` is the one EAS built. `functions/src/androidCore.ts` serves it, anonymously: `GET /api/android/latest` gives `{version, versionCode, sha256, published_at, url}` with an hour's signed URL, and `GET /api/android/download` redirects to it. Both answer 404 until a release exists. The serving rules are shared with the tray (`functions/src/releaseCore.ts`), and the functions test builds its fixture with the same `buildLatest`, so the writer and the endpoint can't drift apart. `node scripts/android-release.mjs check android-v1.2.0` fails unless the tag matches `app.json`'s `expo.version`.

## Release (tag workflow)

A release is an `android-v<version>` tag on main; nothing builds on merge. `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`:

1. **check**: the tagged commit is on main, the tag is `android-v` + `app.json`'s `expo.version`, and the types, jest and `scripts/` tests pass.
2. **build** (Environment `android-build`, holds `EXPO_TOKEN`, no reviewer): `eas build --profile release --wait --json` (eas-cli pinned in the workflow). The `release` profile in `eas.json` builds an APK; `autoIncrement` with `appVersionSource: remote` means EAS owns `versionCode`, and a failed build still uses one up. `scripts/android-release.mjs build` reads the finished build from EAS's JSON (id, `appBuildVersion` as versionCode, the APK URL); `verify` checks the downloaded APK with `apksigner` and `aapt2`: signed by the certificate pinned in `scripts/android-signer.json`, package `app.botracing.android`, `versionName` = the tag, `versionCode` = EAS's. Any mismatch stops the run before anyone is asked to approve. If EAS fails, the run fails; there is no local-build fallback. No workflow artifact carries the APK: the repo is public, so anyone could download it before the approval.
3. **publish** (Environment `android-release`, Botkin approves each run; `EXPO_TOKEN` and `ANDROID_RELEASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`): fetches the same build from EAS by id (`eas build:view`, same id and versionCode), `latest` checks the APK again and lays out `android/<version>/BotRacing-<version>.apk` and `android/latest.json`; `scripts/publish-release.sh` uploads the APK create-only (a version is never overwritten), then `latest.json`, as the `android-release` account, which can write only under `android/` (`ops/iam/ciSplitPlan.mjs`).

To release: raise `expo.version` in `app.json` in a PR; after it merges, an admin tags main:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git tag android-v1.0.1 origin/main
git push origin android-v1.0.1
```

then approves the publish job in Actions once the build is green. Only admins may create, move or delete `android-v*` and `tray-v*` tags (the repo ruleset `Release tags`).

### One-time setup

`scripts/setup-android-release.ps1` (run `-DryRun` first): the two Environments, `EXPO_TOKEN` in both (a robot token from expo.dev > botventure > Settings > Access tokens, passed as `-ExpoToken` or `$env:EXPO_TOKEN`), the `Release tags` ruleset, and `node ops/iam/ciSplit.mjs grant --apply` for the `android-release` account and its key. It prints names, never values.

By hand, once:

- **Back up the signing key.** EAS holds it (never the repo or GitHub). `npx eas-cli@24.8.0 credentials -p android`, profile `release`, then Keystore > Download existing keystore: it saves the `.jks` and prints its passwords. Keep both in the password manager. Lose the key and installed apps can't update; every user reinstalls.
- **Pin its certificate.** The same `credentials` screen prints the keystore's SHA-256 fingerprint. Put it, lowercase without colons, in `scripts/android-signer.json` (`certSha256`) in a PR. Until it is pinned, the build job stops and prints the APK's certificate SHA-256, which is the same value.
- **Google sign-in.** Google Cloud console (project botracing-61) > APIs & Services > Credentials > the Android OAuth client for `app.botracing.android`: add the keystore's SHA-1 (also on the `credentials` screen). Without it, Google sign-in on the installed APK answers DEVELOPER_ERROR (`src/auth/googleClient.ts`).

Settings shows an **Android app** card (`src/features/settings/androidCard.ts`). In the installed app it appears only when `/api/android/latest` has a higher `versionCode` than the installed one (`expo-application`'s `nativeBuildVersion`), with an Update button. In a browser on an Android phone it offers the APK, like the Windows card. Anywhere else there is no card. Both open `/api/android/download` in the browser, so the first install asks to allow installs from the browser; the card says so in one line.

## Over-the-air updates (EAS Update)

`expo-updates` checks the `production` channel on launch and applies a new bundle on the next start (no UI). Only the `release` profile in `eas.json` has the channel, so development and preview builds never receive production updates. `app.json` sets `runtimeVersion.policy: "fingerprint"`: an update reaches only builds with the same native fingerprint, so a native change can never land on an older APK.

`.github/workflows/ota-update.yml` runs `tsc` and `jest` on the pushed commit (the Tests workflow runs on pull requests only), then `eas update --channel production --platform android`, on a push to main that changes `app/`, `src/`, `assets/`, `app.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` or the babel/metro config. Docs, tools, functions and desktop changes do not run it.

- **By update:** screens, logic, styles, JS-only dependencies, images and other assets.
- **Needs an APK (new `android-v*` tag):** a native module or SDK change, `app.json` plugins, permissions, icon or splash, package name. These change the fingerprint; an update published for the new fingerprint reaches phones only after they install that APK.
- **Roll back:** `npx eas-cli@24.8.0 update:republish --channel production --group <group id of the last good update>` (`eas update:list --branch production` shows the groups). Phones take it on their next launch.
- **Same runtime version as the APK:** the build and the update both compute it with `@expo/fingerprint` over the same commit after `npm ci` (tracked files, `node_modules`, `app.json`, `eas.json`; no local-only files). `fingerprint.config.js` skips package.json scripts, `.gitignore` and version strings, so editing those does not strand phones. Check locally: `npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform android`; the hash must equal the `Runtime version` in the OTA job summary (which also lists the update group id and message).
- **APK updates are unchanged:** the Settings Android card still offers a new APK by `versionCode`.

One-time setup (Botkin):

- GitHub > Settings > Environments > New environment `ota-update`, no reviewer.
- In it, add secret `EXPO_TOKEN` (a robot token from expo.dev > botventure > Settings > Access tokens; the one in `android-build` works).
- Updates start with the 1.0.2 APK: older installs have no updater.
