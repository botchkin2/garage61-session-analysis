// Corner windows that tile the lap (pit-wall thread 45, setup #1587 and #1589,
// decided #1590, hardened #1608): an ordered list of boundaries from the
// start/finish line to the line, each section's window running from one
// boundary to the next, so the windows add up to the lap time and nothing wraps
// or borrows from the next lap.
//
// A boundary sits on the straight before a section, a margin before where the
// earliest laps at the layout start braking (or, for a section nobody brakes
// for, lifting), where every lap is still doing the same speed. On a flat-out
// straight the exact metre costs every lap the same time, so the line falls
// where laps agree instead of mid-brake where they already differ. The map's
// own entry (the median onset) is not used for it: about half the laps brake
// before a median, and a map built from one car puts it wrong for another.
//
// "Earliest" is a low percentile of the pooled laps, not a minimum, so one lap
// that coasts, spins or runs wide cannot drag a boundary hundreds of metres
// early. The pool keeps a histogram per session, so a resync replaces a
// session's own laps instead of counting them twice, and until it holds
// enough laps from enough sessions the boundary is provisional (the map's
// entry), so no single session sets one.
//
// The line is always a boundary. The last section's window ends at it and the
// stretch from the line to the first section's start is its own unit, the start
// straight. Nothing here knows a track; E8's custom sectors are this same list
// with boundaries the driver places.
//
// Every distance here is in the map's frame, the lap's fraction times the track
// map's length (as the slices already are), never a recording's raw lap
// distance: recordings differ by metres in length and alignment, so onsets
// pooled across sessions in raw distance would smear.
//
// Plain TypeScript with erasable syntax only, no imports: Node runs it as is.
